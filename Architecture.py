### Lesson-00: "Architecture"

## In this program, we will learn about the architecture of a same Python-3 program.

class class_name: # Create a Class
  def fx(self): 
    # Defined function
    # You can set some of the conditions, events, or both in here.
    pass
  # Also, you can set more functions in here unless your program may need.
  pass

obj = class_name() # Create Object.

# Call the fx method on the instance
obj.fx()

str = "Hello World!" # String
init = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 # Integer
num = 0.0,1.0,2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0 # Float
bool = True,False # Boolean
list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0] # List
array = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],['',0,'']] # 2D array

## Now, let's we try to show out the str, init, num, bool, list, and array.
print(str)
for i in range(10): # For loop
  print(init[i])
for i in range(6):
  print(num[i])
print(bool)
print(list)
for i in range(4):
  print(array[i])

while True: # While loop
  break

## The above is a basic example structure.
