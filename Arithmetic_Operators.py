### Lesson-05: Operator
## In this lesson, we will learn about the operators in python.
## Arithmetic Operators:
# +, -, *, /, //, %, **
print("1+2=",1+2)
print("3-4=",3-4)
print("5*6=",5*6)
print("7/8=",7/8)
print("9//10=",9//10)
print("1%2=",11%12)
print("2**3=",2**3)
## The operators can help us to do easily calculations.
