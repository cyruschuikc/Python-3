### Lesson-03: Data Type
## In this lesson, we will learn about the data type in python.
## Frist, we might make sure to know about all the data type, such as:
## 1. Integer
## 2. Float
## 3. String
## 4. Boolean

# Integer number:
## Integer number is a number without decimal point.
INT_num = 1

# Float:
## Float is a number with decimal point.
FLOAT_num = 2.34

# String:
## String is a text.
text = "Hello, World!"

# Boolean:
## Boolean is a True or False.
booleanT = True
booleanF = False

## When our program have a TypeError, we might need to check the data type of variable or function.
## In that case, We can use the type() function to check the data type. Type is a function that will show the data type.
print(type(INT_num))
print(type(FLOAT_num))
print(type(text))
print(type(booleanT))
print(type(booleanF))
