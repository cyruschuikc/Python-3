### Lesson-02: Print()
## At the last lesson we also had used print() function to print some of things.
## However, in this lesson, we will learn more about the print() function.
## The print() function is used to print anything in the console.
## While we want to print a text, we need to use print() and put the text inside the ().
## For example:
print("ABC")
## Also, you can use '' to do it.
print('ABC')
## Furthermore, you can print a number as integer or float.
print(123)
print(1.23)
## We can also print a variable,boolean,one-dimensional array and two-dimensional array.
letter = "ABC"
print(letter)
print(True)
print(False)
print([1,2,3,4,5])
print([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])
