### Lesson-01: Say 'Hello'
## In this lesson, we will learn how to print a message in the console.
## Frist, we might use the print() function.
print("Hello!") # print a word
## Additionally, we can print a short sentence or a complete sentence.
print("Hello, my name is Chris.")
print("Hello, my name is Chris, 16s. I'm a student.")
## Here are an commonly example.
print("Hello, World.")
## However, please pay attention here. Because '' and "" although is the same.
## But there are some differences in their usage. Here are some examples.
print('Hello!') # Use ''
print("Hello!") # Use ""
print("'Hello'") # Use '' in ""
print('"Hello"') # Use "" in ''
## All in all, we can use either '' or "" to print a message. 
## But, sometimes we will use '' to surround certain words in a text.
## So, We should get used to using "" first when outputting words or a sentence.
## This is the end of this lesson. Thank you for your attention.
